ABOUT:
yaska was an ancient vedic grammarian and also happens to be the eponym
for this utility

WHY:
basically I have 6-7 grammars that are ALL dealing with natural 
language and it is basically a real bitch sometimes to figure out if
I'm making the right changes as I don't have that much experience with
pegs in general and antlr in specific -- I've racked up quite a few
run-time warnings dealing with this since my tests convey such a wide-range
of natural-language expressions

this test-suite allows you to sit back and concentrate on the grammar                                             
w/out having to resort to antlworks knowing that whenever you make a 
change your tests are passing and are making progress
